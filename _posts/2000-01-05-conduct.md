The Dublin Scala User Group strives to be nice fun place for all. We have adopted the **[Type Level Code of Conduct](https://typelevel.org/conduct.html)** to ensure we are a welcoming and fair group for everyone.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a member of the [commitee](#contact)

### Code of Conduct

Typelevel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and programming background. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the community organizers.
