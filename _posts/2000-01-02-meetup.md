We organise monthly meetups on [meetup.com](https://https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Scala-users-group) on the 4th Tuesday of the month. Most of our meetups are hosted by companies working with Scala around Dublin. These include talks by local and international speakers, we always strive to include lightning talks to encourage new speakers to participate. Most hosts provide some food and beer to encourage networking and debate. Occasionally we just get together local pub for a chat.
